# Means Of Circuit Design

This is an assortment of symbols and footprints we created for our work at Fully Automated.

Feel free to upstream if you see something you like, or just use as is for OSHW projects which are not affiliated with organizations violating human rights.

## KiCad 3D models
Put 3D models (step and wrl) into the 3D folder.

You need to define the AUTOMATEDDIR in the footprint editor tool (KiCad 5): Preferences -> Configure Paths -> 3D Search Paths  
Alias: AUTOMATEDDIR  
Path: (location of this repository on your disk)

When adding footprints, the 3D model should be referenced as AUTOMATEDDIR:3D/whatever-file.step and such.
